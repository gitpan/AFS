=head1 NAME

B<AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL> - Class to handle the B<AFS structure ktc_principal>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL;
  use AFS::Cell qw(localcell);

  my ($name, $inst, $cell) = AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL->ParseLoginName('nog.admin@MPA-GARCHING.MPG.DE');
  print "name     = ", $name, "\n";
  print "instance = ", $inst, "\n";
  print "cell     = ", $cell, "\n\n";

  my $user = AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL->new('nog', '', localcell);

  print "name      = ", $user->name, "\n";
  print "instance  = ", $user->instance, "\n";
  print "cell      = ", $user->cell, "\n";
  print "principal = ", $user->principal, "\n";

  $user->set("rjsnfs", "root", localcell);
  print "principal = ", $user->principal, "\n";
  undef $user;

  my $index =0;
  while( $service = AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL->ListTokens($index)) {
      print "\nToken Num =  $index\n";
      print "name      = ", $service->name, "\n";
      print "instance  = ", $service->instance, "\n";
      print "cell      = ", $service->cell, "\n";
      print "principal = ", $service->principal, "\n";
  }
  undef $service;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides methods to handle the B<AFS structure ktc_principal>.
This structure represents a principal which is used in the I<Kernel Token
Cache> (KTC).  All entities on the network (users and services) are
called I<principals>.  The KTC is part of the Cache Manager.

It is used to create, modify, and retrieve B<ktc_principal> instances.
It has methods to retrieve and to reset the B<KTC_principal>
attributes.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

B<This release does NOT support any features and interfaces
from version 1.>

=head1 OBJECT ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item B<name>

Name of the user or service.

=item B<instance>

Instance of the user or service.

=item B<cell>

Name of the cell

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<CONSTRUCTOR>

=item S< >

=item B<$princ = AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL-E<gt>new(NAME [, INSTANCE [, CELL]]);>

=item B<$princ = AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL-E<gt>new(NAME.INSTANCE@CELL);>

Creates a new object of the class AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL and sets its
values for NAME, INSTANCE and CELL.

=item B<$service = AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL-E<gt>ListTokens(INDEX);>

Searches in the token cache for the INDEX+1th token. On success it
returns the corresponding principal instance $service and it
increments INDEX.  If there is no INDEX+1th element AFS::CODE is set
and the return value is C<undef>.  It calls the AFS system library
function 'ktc_ListTokens'.

=item B<CLASS METHODS>

=item S< >

=item B<($name, $instance, $cell) = AFS::KTC_PRINCIPAL-E<gt>ParseLoginName(LOGIN);>

Parses the string LOGIN. It defines a syntax to allow a user to
specify his identity in terms of his name, instance and cell with a
single string. The syntax is very simple: the first dot ('.')
separates the name from the instance and the first atsign ('@') begins
the cell name.  A backslash ('\') can be used to quote these special
characters.  It calls the AFS system library function
'ka_ParseLoginName'.

=item B<ATTRIBUTES ACCESS>

=item S< >

=item B<$princ-E<gt>ATTRIBUTE([value]);>

Retrieves or sets the value for the specified object attribute, where
ATTRIBUTE is one of the above listed object attributes (e.g. C<name>).

=item B<INSTANCE METHODS>

=item S< >

=item B<$princ-E<gt>set(NAME, INSTANCE, CELL);>

=item B<$princ-E<gt>set(NAME.INSTANCE@CELL);>

Resets the value of the attributes NAME, INSTANCE and CELL for the
principal instance.
