B<AFS::Utils> - Shared utility functions for the B<AFS module bundle>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AFS::Utils qw (
                    XSVERSION get_server_version get_syslib_version
                    setpag sysname unlog
                    );

  my $ok = setpag();
  print "Return Code = $ok\n";

  print 'XS-Version = ', XSVERSION, "\n";
  print 'Syslib Version = ', get_syslib_version, "\n";
  print 'Server Version = ', get_server_version('pts', 'ibm-1'), "\n";

  my $sysname = sysname;

  unlog;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides several utility functions for the B<AFS module
bundle>.  You can retrieve the version number for the underlying AFS
system libraries, for the XS module, and for the AFS server processes.
And it contains several commands that do not belong to any AFS command
suites like creating a new PAG or retrieving and setting the
CPU/operating system type. Any function required must by explicitly
listed by the C<use> statement to be exported into the calling package.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

B<This release does NOT support any features and interfaces
from version 1.>

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 Standard Exports

none

=head2 Optional Exports

The following functions will be exported into your namespace if you
specifically ask that they be imported.

=over 4

=item B<$version = XSVERSION;>

Reports the version number of the underlying XS file.

=item B<$version = get_server_version(SERVER [, HOST [, VERBOSE]]);>

Reports the version number of the SERVER process running at HOST
(default localhost). If VERBOSE (default 0) is set to 1 some program
trace is printed.

=item B<$version = get_syslib_version;>

Reports the version number of the underlying AFS system library.

=item B<$ok = setpag;>

Creates a new command shell (owned by the issuer of the command) and
associates a new process authentication group (PAG) with the shell and
the user. A PAG is a number guaranteed to identify the issuer of
commands in the new shell uniquely to the local Cache Manager.

=item B<$sysname = sysname([NEWSYSNAME]);>

Reports the CPU/operating system type or sets the CPU/operating system
type to NEWSYSNAME.

=item B<unlog;>

Discards all of the issuer's tokens.
