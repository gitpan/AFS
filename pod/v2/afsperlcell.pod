=head1 NAME

B<AFS::Cell> - Module to administer B<AFS Cells>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AFS::Cell qw (configdir expandcell getcell
                    getcellinfo localcell
                    whichcell wscell
                   );

  my $conf_dir = configdir;

  my $cell = expandcell('mpa');
  $cell = localcell;
  $cell = whichcell('./');
  $cell = wscell;

  ($cell, my @hosts) = getcellinfo;
  print "Cell: $cell\n";
  foreach my $host (@hosts) {
      print(" $host\n");
  }

B<NOTE: The following lines are 'version 1' style: all names are
exported by default. This style is deprecated !!!>

  use AFS;              # import all AFS names
  use AFS @AFS::CELL;   # import just the cell config names

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides several functions to configure and to maintain an
B<AFS cell>.  It is used to maintain the configuration directory.  Any
function required must by explicitly listed on the use line to be
exported into the calling package.

Some of these functions have the optional argument FOLLOW.  FOLLOW
determines which file should be used should PATH be a symbolic link.  If
FOLLOW be set to 1, then the symbolic link is followed to its target.
If FOLLOW is set to 0, then the function applies to the symbolic link
itself.  If not specified FOLLOW defaults to 1.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

In version 2 all functions are exported only on request.  The old
behavior from version 1 (export by default) is still available for
compatibility, but is deprecated.

=item B<$dir = configdir;>

=item B<$ok = configdir(DIR);>

Gets or sets the configuration directory for an AFS server/client
machine. Default is /usr/vice/etc.

=item B<$cellname = expandcell(CELL);>

Expands CELL to the fully qualified cellname. Returns undef on error.

=cut

# does not work properly, return value $cell is not set properly ???

# =item B<($cell, @servers)  = getcell(INDEX [,IP]);>

# Displays the list of the database server machines that the Cache Manager
# stores in kernel memory for its home cell and foreign cells.

# Iterates through the Cache Manager's internal cell configuration,
# using INDEX as an index. The index starts at 0. $AFS::CODE will
# be set to a non-zero value when passed an invalid index. If IP is
# set to 1 then IP addresses will be returned instead of hostnames.
# Displays each database server machine's IP address rather than hostname.

=item B<($cell @servers) = getcellinfo([CELL [,IP]]);>

Gets information on CELL (default NULL) using CellServDB. If IP (default
0) is set to 1 then IP addresses will be returned instead of hostnames.

=item B<$cellname = localcell;>

Returns the cellname of the local cell. Returns undef on error.

=item B<$cellname = whichcell(PATH [,FOLLOW]);>

Returns the name of the cell in which the volume that houses PATH
resides.  Returns undef and sets CODE on error.

=item B<$cellname = wscell;>

Returns the name of the local machine's home cell.
