=head1 NAME

B<AFS::KTC_EKEY> - Class to handle the B<AFS structure ktc_encryptionkey>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AFS::KTC_EKEY;
  use AFS::Cell qw(localcell);

  my $key = AFS::KTC_EKEY->ReadPassword('Password:');
  print 'KEY = ', $key->string, " \n";

  my $string = AFS::KTC_EKEY->UserReadPassword('Password:');
  $key = AFS::KTC_EKEY->StringToKey($string, localcell);
  print 'KEY = ', $key->string, " \n";

  $key = AFS::KTC_EKEY->des_string_to_key('aaa');
  print 'KEY = ', $key->string, " \n";

  undef $key;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides methods to handle the B<AFS structure ktc_encryptionkey>.
This structure represents an encryption key which is used in the I<Kernel
Token Cache> (KTC). The KTC is part of the Cache Manager.  It is used to
create B<ktc_encryptionkey> instances.

=over 4

=item B<CONSTRUCTOR>

=item S< >

=item B<$key = AFS::KTC_EKEY-E<gt>des_string_to_key(STRING);>

The STRING string is converted to a DES encryption key and this key is
returned as an AFS::KTC_EKEY object.  It calls the AFS system library
function 'des_string_to_key'.

=item B<$key = AFS::KTC_EKEY-E<gt>ReadPassword(PROMPT [, VERIFY [, CELL]]);>

Prints out a PROMPT and reads a string from the terminal, turning off
echoing.  If VERIFY (default 0) is set to 1 it requests that the string
be entered again and the two strings are compared.  CELL defaults to
NULL. The string is then converted to a DES encryption key and the
encryption key is returned as an AFS::KTC_EKEY object.  It calls the AFS
system library function 'ka_ReadPassword'.

=item B<$key = AFS::KTC_EKEY-E<gt>StringToKey(PASSWD, CELL);>

The PASSWD string is converted to a DES encryption key and this key is
returned as an AFS::KTC_EKEY object.  It calls the AFS system library
function 'ka_StringToKey'.

=item B<CLASS METHODS>

=item S< >

=item B<$string = AFS::KTC_EKEY-E<gt>UserReadPassword(PROMPT [, REASON]);>

Prints out a PROMPT and reads a string from the terminal, turning off
echoing.  This string is returned.  On error the error message is
returned in REASON.  It calls the AFS system library function
'ka_UserReadPassword'.

=item B<ATTRIBUTES ACCESS>

=item S< >

=item B<$key-E<gt>string;>

Returns the whole encryption key as a string.
