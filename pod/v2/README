This is the README file for the POD documentation of the Perl
extension module AFS (Version 2.2.0) 


POD DOCUMENTATION
    The included POD documentation in this directory is the unique and
    up to date documentation source for the AFS module bundle.  It can
    be used by the 'perldoc' program, and may be used to generate HTML
    documentation usable by WWW browsers, and documentation in several
    other formats.


GENERATING HTML DOCUMENTATION
    If you have some WWW browser available, it might be worthwhile to
    build HTML docs.  Unfortunately the perl Makefile.PL infrastructure
    won't do this for you automatically.  You have to generate it
    explicitly.  'cd' into the pod directory and 'make' the HTML
    documentation.  This is the sequence of commands to build the docs:

        cd AFS-2.2.0/pod/v2
        make html

    After this you can start your browser with the file 'afsperl.html'
    in this directory, and go ahead with reading docs.
