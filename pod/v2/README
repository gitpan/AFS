This is the README file for the POD documentation of the Perl
extension module AFS (Version 2.6.3) 


POD DOCUMENTATION
    The included POD documentation in this directory is the unique and
    up to date documentation source for the AFS module bundle.  It can
    be used by the 'perldoc' program, and may be used to generate HTML
    documentation usable by WWW browsers, and documentation in several
    other formats.


GENERATING HTML DOCUMENTATION
    If you have some WWW browser available, it might be worthwhile to
    build HTML docs.  Unfortunately the perl Makefile.PL
    infrastructure won't do this for you automatically.  You have to
    generate it explicitly.  'cd' into the top directory and 'make'
    the HTML documentation.  This is the sequence of commands to build
    the docs:

        cd AFS-2.6.3
        perl Makefile.PL  ;#(if you have not submitted already)
        make html

    After this you can start your browser with the file 

            AFS-2.6.3/lib/AFS.html

    and go ahead with reading docs.
