This is the INSTALL file for the Perl extension module AFS (Version v2.6.3)
for the OpenAFS 32-bit version

README
    Read the README file first.


AVAILABILITY
    The latest version of the AFS module bundle is currently available at

        http://www.MPA-Garching.MPG.de/~nog/perl/AFS-<version>.tar.gz
        http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/N/NO/NOG/AFS-<version>.tar.gz


RECOMMENDATIONS
    It is highly recommended to place the installation directory in
    the AFS file system.  Otherwise most of the test cases
    ('make test') are skipped.


REQUIREMENTS
    Before you can build the AFS module bundle you need to have the
    following installed on your system:

        * Perl v5.10.0 or newer
        * C compiler
        * OpenAFS system libraries 32-bit version


BUILDING & INSTALLING
    Building the modules is straightforward. The AFS module bundle is
    distributed as a single gzipped tar archive file:

            AFS-<version>.tar.gz

    Unpack the archive to create an AFS installation directory:

        gunzip AFS-<version>.tar.gz
        tar xvf AFS-<version>.tar

    'cd' into that directory, make, test and install the modules.

    You have to specify the location of the AFS system
    libraries. While running the 'perl Makefile.PL' step you will be
    prompted for the location of the AFS system libraries.  If you
    want to avoid that query, you should specify the environment
    variable 'AFSPATH' before you start [1].

    If your AFS system type is not yet known by the make file because
    you can't run the "fs sysname" command, you can specify the
    environment variable 'AFS_SYSNAME' before you start [2].

    This is the sequence of commands to build the modules:

        cd AFS-<version>

        [1] this step is optional
        setenv AFSPATH 'path_to_the_AFS_system_libraries' # tcsh-shell
        export AFSPATH='path_to_the_AFS_system_libraries' # sh-shell

        [2] this step is optional
        setenv AFS_SYSNAME 'AFS_system_type'              # tcsh-shell
        export AFS_SYSNAME 'AFS_system_type'              # sh-shell

        perl Makefile.PL
             ---->  Which AFS system libraries should be used? [/usr/afsws]
        make
        make test
        make install
        make html   ;#(if you want to get the HTML documentation, see also next section)


PLATFORMS
    In the meantime I have only access to Linux machines. Therefore I
    have tested this version of the AFS module bundle only on the Linux
    platform with the following combinations

        OS             @sys         compiler    OpenAFS    Perl   (threaded/non-threaded)

FEEDBACK
    If you are building the modules on another architecture I would
    appreciate a note to tell me how you got on. Although I am
    particularly interested to hear about any problems you encounter
    when building the system, I would still like to hear from you even
    if you don't.

    Things I particularly would like to know

       * The Operating system name and version, e.g. SunOS 4.1.3
       * Architecture, e.g. Solaris
       * C compiler, e.g. gcc
       * Where there any warnings/errors printed by the C compiler? If so
         please send the exact output if possible.
       * The Perl version
       * The version of the AFS system libraries


KNOWN PROBLEMS
    Under SunOS, several people have encountered problems while compiling
    and installing the AFS module bundle.
