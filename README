This is the README file for the Perl extension module AFS (Version 2.6.0) 


DESCRIPTION
    The AFS module bundle is a dynamically loadable extension to
    Perl. It gives the AFS user and administrator access to many of the
    AFS programming APIs, allowing you to make these calls directly from
    Perl, rather than processing the output of a command.


REQUIREMENTS
    Before you can build the AFS module bundle you need to have the
    following installed on your system:

        * Perl 5.005_02 or newer
        * system libraries for OpenAFS or IBM AFS (version 3.6)
        * GNU gcc (on solaris-2.[5-9])


RESTRICTIONS
    This release
        * does not support AFS system libraries version 3.4 or version 3.5 !!!
        * does not support "version 1" features and styles anymore


RECOMMENDATIONS
    It is highly recommended to place the installation directory in
    the AFS file system.  Otherwise most of the test cases
    ('make test') are skipped.


AVAILABILITY
    The latest version of the AFS module bundle is currently available at

        http://www.MPA-Garching.MPG.de/~nog/perl/AFS-2.6.0.tar.gz
        http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/N/NO/NOG/AFS-2.6.0.tar.gz


BUILDING & INSTALLING
    Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the modules
    should be straightforward. The AFS module bundle is distributed as a
    single gzipped tar archive file:

            AFS-2.6.0.tar.gz

    Unpack the archive to create an AFS installation directory:

        gunzip AFS-2.6.0.tar.gz
        tar xvf AFS-2.6.0.tar

    'cd' into that directory, make, test and install the modules. You
    have to specify the location of the AFS system libraries. While
    running the 'perl Makefile.PL' step you will be prompted for the
    location of the AFS system libraries.  If you want to avoid that
    query, you should specify the environment variable 'AFSPATH'
    before you start[1].  If your AFS system type is not yet known by
    the make file, please follow the printed message.  

    This is the sequence of commands to build the modules:

        cd AFS-2.6.0

        [1] this step is optional
        setenv AFSPATH 'path_to_the_AFS_system_libraries' # tcsh-shell
        export AFSPATH='path_to_the_AFS_system_libraries' # sh-shell

        perl Makefile.PL
             ---->  Which AFS system libraries should be used? [/usr/afsws]
        make
        make test
        make install
        make html   ;#(if you want to get the HTML documentation, see also next section)


DOCUMENTATION
    The POD documentation automatically installed to the system wide
    Perl documentation.  It is readable with the 'perldoc' utility.

    For information about HTML documentation, please check the file
    'pod/v2/README'. 


EXAMPLES
    The 'examples' directory contains some simple examples how to use
    the AFS modules.  However I do not guarantee these scripts to
    work.


MAJOR CHANGES (from major release 1 to major release 2)
    This module bundle compiles with the AFS system libraries for IBM
    AFS version 3.6.x and with the AFS system libraries for all
    OpenAFS versions.

    Since OpenAFS is running on an increasingly number of platforms so
    does the AFS Perl module.  Whereever you can compile OpenAFS and
    Perl you should be able to install the ASF Perl module.

    The constructor methods for all AFS classes have been corrected to
    conform with the Perl OO conventions.

    In order to have clean Perl interfaces the AFS Perl code has been
    separated into several logical modules.  Where suited the modules
    have been implemented as OO classes.

    For more details, please see the file named 'CHANGES which should
    have been included in the AFS module distribution.


COMPATIBILITY
    In major release 2 (version 2), all functions and special
    variables have been resorted into separate modules according to
    their affiliations to different AFS command suits.  These resorted
    functions and variables are not exported by default anymore but
    they are exported only on request.

    This release does NOT support any features and interfaces from
    version 1.


PLATFORMS
    In the meantime I have only access to Linux machines.  Therefore I
    have tested this version of the AFS module bundle only on the
    Linux platform with the following combinations

        OS             @sys         compiler    OpenAFS    Perl
        -------------------------------------------------------
        Linux          i386_linux26   gcc       1.4.2      5.6.2
                       i386_linux26   gcc       1.4.5      5.6.2
                       i386_linux26   gcc       1.4.7      5.6.2
                       i386_linux26   gcc       1.4.2      5.8.8
                       i386_linux26   gcc       1.4.5      5.8.8
                       i386_linux26   gcc       1.4.7      5.8.8

    For former versions I have also got reports that it is running on
    configurations, not available to me.

FEEDBACK
    If you are building the modules on another architecture I would
    appreciate a note to tell me how you got on. Although I am
    particularly interested to hear about any problems you encounter
    when building the system, I would still like to hear from you even
    if you don't.

    Things I particularly would like to know

       * The Operating system name and version, e.g. SunOS 4.1.3
       * Architecture, e.g. Solaris
       * C compiler, e.g. gcc
       * Where there any warnings/errors printed by the C compiler? If so
         please send the exact output if possible.
       * The Perl version
       * The version of the AFS system libraries


CAVEATS
    A few methods from the AFS command suite BOS are not yet
    released.  For details, please see 'AFS/BOS.pod'.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
    Under SunOS, several people have encountered problems while compiling
    and installing the AFS module bundle.


BUGS
    Please send all bug reports and suggestions for improvements to
    Norbert E Gruener <nog@MPA-Garching.MPG.de>.  When reporting
    bugs/problems please include information about operating system
    version, perl version, AFS version, AFS module version.  Comments
    and suggestions are always welcome.
