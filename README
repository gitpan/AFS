This is the README file for the Perl extension module AFS (version V_2_0)


DESCRIPTION
    The AFS module bundle is a dynamically loadable extension to
    Perl. It gives the AFS user and administrator access to many of the
    AFS programming APIs, allowing you to make these calls directly from
    Perl, rather then processing the output of a command.


REQUIREMENTS
    Before you can build the AFS module bundle you need to have the
    following installed on your system:

        * Perl 5.005_02 or later
        * system libraries for IBM AFS (version 3.4 or later) or OpenAFS
        * GNU gcc (on solaris-2.{5,6,7,8})


BUILDING & INSTALLING
    Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the modules
    should be straightforward. The AFS module bundle is distributed as a
    single gzipped tar archive file:

            AFS-<version>.tar.gz

    Note that "<version>" represents the current AFS Revision number, of
    the form "1.5".

    Unpack the archive to create an AFS installation directory:

        gunzip AFS-<version>.tar.gz
        tar xvf AFS-<version>.tar

    'cd' into that directory, make, test and install the modules. You
    have to specify the location of the AFS system libraries. While
    running the perl make script you will be prompted for the location
    of the AFS system libraries.  If your AFS system type is not yet
    known by the make file, please follow the printed message.  This is
    the sequence of commands to build the modules:

        cd AFS-<version>
        perl Makefile.PL
             ---->  Which AFS system libraries should be used? [/usr/afsws]
        make
        make test
        make install


FEEDBACK
    I have tested/run the AFS module bundle on several configurations
    and I have also got reports that it is running on configuration, not
    available to me.

    If you are building the modules on another architecture I would
    appreciate a note to tell me how you got on. Although I am
    particularly interested to hear about any problems you encounter
    when building the system, I would still like to hear from you even
    if you don't.

    Things I particularly would like to know

       * The Operating system name and version, e.g. SunOS 4.1.3
       * Architecture, e.g. Solaris
       * C compiler, e.g. gcc
       * Where there any warnings/errors printed by the C compiler? If so
         please send the exact output if possible.
       * The Perl version
       * The version of the AFS system libraries


Availability
    The latest version of the AFS module bundle is currently available
    at

        http://www.MPA-Garching.MPG.de/~nog/perl/AFS-2.0.tar.gz
        http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/N/NO/NOG/AFS-2.0.tar.gz


MAJOR CHANGES

    This module bundle compiles now with the AFS system libraries for
    IBM AFS version 3.4.x, 3.5.x, 3.6.x and with the AFS system
    libraries for all OpenAFS versions.

    Since OpenAFS is running on an increasingly number of platforms so
    does the AFS Perl module.  Everywhere you can compile OpenAFS and
    Perl you should be able to install the ASF Perl module.

    The constructor methods for all AFS classes have been corrected to
    conform with the Perl OO conventions.

    In order to have clean Perl interfaces the AFS Perl code has been
    separated into several logical modules.  All modules have been
    implemented as OO classes.

    For more details, please see the file named 'ChangeLog' which should
    have been included in the AFS module distribution.


COMPATIBILITY
    In version 2, all functions and special variables have been resorted
    into separate modules according to their affiliations to different
    AFS command suits.  These resorted functions and variables are not
    exported by default anymore but they are exported only on request.

    All variables and functions from version 1 are still available for
    compatibility, but are deprecated.  These cases have been marked in
    the documentation.

    You must not intermix names or interfaces from version 1 with names
    or interfaces from version 2. You either stick with version 1 or
    version 2.


DOCUMENTATION
    POD-format documentation for version 1 style is found in the
    directory 'pod/v1' and for version 2 style in the directory
    'pod/v2'.  POD is readable with the 'perldoc' utility.


EXAMPLES
    The 'examples' directory contains some simple examples of using the
    AFS modules.  In the directory 'examples/v1' you will find version 1
    style examples and in the directory 'examples/v2' you will find
    version 2 style examples.  However I do not guarantee these scripts
    to work.
