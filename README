This is the README file for the Perl extension module bundle AFS (Version v2.6.4)


DESCRIPTION
    The AFS module bundle is a dynamically loadable extension to Perl.
    It gives the AFS user and AFS administrator access to many of the
    AFS programming APIs, allowing them to make these calls directly from
    Perl, rather than processing the output of a command.


WHAT'S NEW?
    Version v2.6.4 is just a bug fixing release.
    For more details, please see the file named 'CHANGES' which should
    have been included in the AFS module distribution.


RESTRICTIONS
    This release
        * does not support Transarc/IBM AFS system libraries version
          3.4 or version 3.5 !!!
        * does not support features and styles from Perl AFS module
          "major version 1"


DEPRECATION
    The module AFS::KAS is deprecated and will be removed in version v2.8.0


INSTALLATION
    If you want to install the AFS module bundle on a 32-bit platform
    read the 'INSTALL' file. For installation on a 64-bit platform read
    the 'INSTALL_64' file.


DOCUMENTATION
    The POD documentation is automatically installed to the system wide
    Perl documentation.  It is readable with the 'perldoc' utility.

    For information about HTML documentation, please check the file
    'pod/v2/README'.


EXAMPLES
    The 'examples' directory contains some simple examples how to use
    the AFS modules.  However I do not guarantee these scripts to
    work.


COMPATIBILITY
    This release does NOT support any features and interfaces from Perl
    AFS modules major version 1.


CAVEATS
    A few methods from the AFS command suite BOS are not yet
    released.  For details, please see 'AFS::BOS.pod'.
